    "Having valid magnetic and electric field inputs is necessary for all ASCOT5 simulations. There are several different magnetic field input types to choose from, but the one most commonly used is `B_2DS` which represents axisymmetric tokamak field interpolated using bicubic splines.\n",

    "and the toroidal component is given as an input. The poloidal flux is in addition used to evaluate the normalized poloidal flux which is used as a flux coordinate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "It is possible to give also the poloidal component separately, but in this case it is summed to the components calculated from the poloidal flux so this possibility is rarely used. If one insists on giving the poloidal components explicitly, one can avoid double counting by multiplying the poloidal flux with a small number but be cautious here as something might break.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are higher level tools that read EQDSK and write it as a `B_2DS` input (see `a5py/preprocessing/eqdsk2input.py`) but here the point is to demonstrate the lower level tools. Before demonstration, we need to create suitable data using the analytical model (see `B_GS` if you wish to learn the details):"

However, the 2D field is guaranteed to be divergence free in the absence of explicitly given $B_\\mathrm{pol}$ ($\\partial_\\phi B_\\phi = 0$ and $B_\\mathrm{pol}$ is calculated from $\\psi$). Other way to validate the grid is to vary the grid resolution and simulate some particles collisionlessly to see if there is artificial transport.\n",
