"""
Module for creating and modifying the HDF5 file and for accessing meta data.

ASCOT5 HDF5 file is built as follows. At top level are parent groups, one (and
only one) for each type of input (e.g. bfield for magnetic field input) and one
parent group that contains all the results.

Parent groups contain groups that hold the actual datasets. Single parent can
have multiple groups e.g. bfield can store multiple magnetic field inputs.
The result group is a different in a sense that it contains run groups, one
for each simulation, which then contain the groups that store inistate,
endstate, and whatever diagnostics were used. However, here we refer to the
top level groups as parents, and the groups that are directly below them
as groups.

A typical structure of a file can be like this:

> /                              <br>
> /bfield                        <br>
> /bfield/B_2DS-1234567890       <br>
> /bfield/B_2DS-2345678901       <br>
> /bfield/B_3DS-3456789012       <br>
> /efield                        <br>
> /efield/E_TC-1234567890        <br>
> /neutral                       <br>
> /neutral/N0_3D-1234567890      <br>
> /plasma                        <br>
> /plasma/plasma_1D-1234567890   <br>
> /wall                          <br>
> /wall/wall_2D-1234567890       <br>
> /options                       <br>
> /options/opt-1234567890        <br>
> /marker                        <br>
> /marker/particle-1234567890    <br>
> /results                       <br>
> /results/run-1234567890        <br>
> /results/run-2345678901        <br>

The number in group name is unique identifier (QID) which is generated when a
group is created. It is generated from a 32 bit random integer and as such it
is almost quaranteed to be unique.

QID is used to determine which input group is active, i.e., to be used in
a simulation, and to which run group the simulation results are written.
QID of the active group is stored as an attribute (in a string format) in the
parent. For the results parent this is the QID of the most recent run (unless
manually changed). Run groups also store QIDs of all input fields used in that
particular run.

All groups also store date and time at which they where created and also a
description field that user can modify at will (see ascot5.py).

The groups should be created, removed, and their metadata accessed via this
module. The actual datasets are accessed via corresponding modules. This module
assumes the HDF5 file is open when these routines are called, and closed
afterwards.
