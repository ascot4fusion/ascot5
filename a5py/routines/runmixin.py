"""Wrapper class for RunNode that adds methods to plot and access results.

The motivation for this class is following. Consider that user wants to plot
a figure that shows i) particle orbits in (R,z), ii) their final (R,z) position,
and iii) the wall tiles. It is not clear whether this plot should be implemented
as a method for State or Orbit class as data from both are needed. Furthermore,
neither has access to the wall data. The only logical place for this method
therefore is in the RunNode that has access to all relevant data.
