"""
Evaluate transport coefficients from marker loss-time.

The first-passage time is the time at which a marker crosses a given boundary
for the first time. If the transport is uniform on a infinite interval and the
the process obeys the Fokker-Planck equation, i.e., advection-diffusion
equation, the first-passage time distribution is the so-called inverse Gaussian
distribution.

Launching a delta distribution of markers from a same flux surface, and using
ASCOT5 to calculate the times at which they are lost, allows one to estimate
the transport coefficients via curve fitting.

In most cases the transport is not uniform and the coefficients have a radial
dependency. However, if we assume that the transport is uniform *locally* and
the transport is biased outwards (drift is positive), the radially dependent
coefficients can be solved:

1. Initialize several delta populations at different radial positions.
2. Solve the loss time for each population with ASCOT5.
3. Solve the transport coefficients for each population using the aforementioned
   method. These are not yet the final coefficients.
4. Now consider two first passage time distributions for a radial population i.
   The first one is the first-passage time at the edge, i.e., the loss-time
   which is known (L_i). The second one is the first-passage time (P_i) at the
   radial position where the next (going outwards) delta population is located.
   Because the loss time of the population i+1 is also known, L_{i+1}, we can
   write the following relation: <L_i> = <P_i> + <L_{i+1}> where brackets
   indicate mean value.
5. Solving for the distribution P_i, we can use that to fit the first-passage
   time distribution which gives as the (final) transport coefficients at
   position i. Formally, this is an inverse problem where we try to find
   K_i and D_i (drift and diffusion coefficient) that relation
   L_i = int_{-inf}^{inf} P_i(t-tau; K_i, D_i)*L_{i+1}(tau) dtau
   is fulfilled. If the relation above is confusing, google "convolution of
   probability distributions".
6. For practical purposes, it is easier to use the coefficients calculated at
   step 3 to express L_{i+1} analytically rather than to use the raw data.
