ASCOT5
======

High-performance orbit-following code for fusion plasma physics and engineering.

If you are a new user, there is no need to ask for a permission to use the code.
However, we, the developers, would welcome it if you'd like to introduce yourself!
You are welcome to present the ASCOT5 work you have done or plan to do in one of our weekly meetings.

This repository is maintained by ASCOT team in Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.

**IMPORTANT**

This repository was just (Sept. 2023) moved from a private server, and the code made open access (see LICENCE).
This process is still underway as we set up the documentation, CI pipelines, and reorganize the files.
In practice this means that:

1. **Please do not use the main and develop branches**
2. If you wish to start using ASCOT5, download the repository and checkout tag ``ascot5.4`` which is the latest release.
3. The next release is being developed in the main and develop branches and major changes are expected in those.

*Thank you for your understanding.*
