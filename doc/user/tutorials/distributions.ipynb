    "## Notes about distributions and moments in ASCOT5\n",
    "\n",
    "ASCOT5 is a kinetic code that solves the Fokker-Planck equation indirectly by tracing weighted markers that form the test particle distribution function.\n",
    "Therefore distribution (histograms), which ASCOT5 collects and which approximate the distribution function, can be considered as the main output of the code.\n",
    "In this example we show how to collect and post-process the distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution function in ASCOT5 is represented by N-dimensional histograms that divide the entire (preferably) possible phase-space into a finite grid.\n",
    "Every time a marker is advanced in a simulation, the code finds the correct bin in the histogram and increments that by marker weight times time-step length.\n",
    "We implicitly assume that the marker weight is in units of ``particles/s`` meaning that the markers represent a constant particle source e.g. alpha particle birth rate.\n",
    "The collected distribution therefore is *a steady-state distribution* and it has units of ``particles``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution function contains all information there is to know about a physical system.\n",
    "Often the distribution function itself is of little interest, and the interesting quantities are the moments of the distribution.\n",
    "While the distribution function is collected during the simulation, the moments are calculated in post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE:_** The resolution of the distribution histogram directly affects the accuracy of the calculated moment(s).\n",
    "> It is therefore advised to allocate as much memory for the distribution that is available and can be reasonably post-processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASCOT5 can be used to collect following distributions, which can be collected simultaneously in a simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``5D`` $(R,\\phi,z,p_\\parallel,p_\\perp)$\n",
    "- ``rho5D`` $(\\rho,\\theta,\\phi,p_\\parallel,p_\\perp)$\n",
    "- ``6D`` $(R,\\phi,z,p_R,p_\\phi,p_z)$\n",
    "- ``rho6D`` $(\\rho,\\theta,\\phi,p_R,p_\\phi,p_z)$\n",
    "- ``COM`` $(E_\\mathrm{kin},P_\\mathrm{ctor},\\mu)$\n",
    "\n",
    "``5D`` and ``rho5D`` are the default distributions and also the ones that should be used in all guiding-center and hybrid simulations.\n",
    "Both distributions can be used in post-processing to evaluate moments of the distribution, but the difference between these two is that only ``rho5D`` can be used to evaluate 1D quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "``6D`` and ``rho6D`` cannot be used to evaluate moments.\n",
    "They are to be used only in gyro-orbit simulations where the particle distribution on itself is of interest: e.g. for marker sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "``COM`` (constant-of-motion) distribution collects the data in kinetic energy, canonical toroidal angular momentum, and magnetic moment coordinates.\n",
    "It cannot be used to compute moments and it is used to provide input from ASCOT5 to other codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "All distributions except for ``COM`` also have additional abscissae in time and charge.\n",
    "Usually these are of little intereset, but make sure to set the charge abscissa properly so that it has a single bin for each expected charge state as otherwise the moments cannot be computed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_Summary:_** Use ``5D`` or ``rho5D`` distribution for guiding center simulations and in any simulations where you wish to calculate moments in post-processing.\n",
    "> For computing 1D profiles and moments, use ``rho5D``.\n",
    "> Use ``6D`` or ``rho6D`` in gyro-orbit simulations when the particle distribution is of specific interest.\n",
    "> If you need the ``COM`` distribution, you'll know it.\n",
