    "# Creating fusion source with AFSI\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to create a fusion source with AFSI in various cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "AFSI (Ascot Fusion Source Integrator) calculates the 5D distributions of fusion reaction products based on the 5D distributions of the reactants.\n",
    "The algorithm iterates over all cells in cylindrical coordinates, and on each location creates fusion products via Monte Carlo sampling.\n",
    "First, a pair of markers is sampled from the reactant (velocity) distributions and the velocities of the fusion products for a given reaction are calculated using the initial velocities.\n",
    "The reaction probability, which depends on the relative velocity between the reactants, is used to weight the products which in turn are used to calculate the 5D distributions for the output.\n",
    "Several pairs are created before the algorithm proceeds to the next cylindrical cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo sampling makes AFSI capable of not only calculating reactions for thermal (Maxwellian) species but for arbitrary distributions.\n",
    "In practice this often means NBI slowing-down distributions and, hence, the arbitrary distribution is referred to as ``beam`` when working with AFSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that AFSI calculates the distributions for both products, i.e., one can use AFSI to calculate the neutron source as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "AFSI has three modes of operation based on what the inputs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``thermal`` calculates the fusion products for two Maxwellian species.\n",
    "  The population can also react itself as is the case with D-D fusion.\n",
    "- ``beam-thermal`` calculates the fusion products for a Maxwellian species that is interacting with an arbitrary distribution.\n",
    "- ``beam-beam`` calculates the fusion products for two arbitrary distributions.\n",
    "  A distribution can interact with itself, e.g. if there is a single deuterium beam.\n",
    " \n",
    "AFSI requires only the magnetic field and plasma data for it to work, but we also need to get the beam ion distribution somewhere for this tutorial.\n",
    "The following cell initializes the inputs and runs a short slowing-down simulation for a deuterium beam.\n",
    "Its contents are not relevant for this tutorial."
