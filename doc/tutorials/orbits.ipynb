    "# Visualizing orbits\n",

    "\n",
    "This example shows how to collect and visualize marker orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed description of the orbit collection options\n",
    "\n",
    "The orbit data collection is one of the diagnostics that can be active in any simulation.\n",
    "Simply put, it records the marker position in phase-space (and some other quantities) at fixed time intervals or when a marker crosses a specific surface.\n",
    "The latter is used to generate Poincaré plots, while the former can be used to evaluate orbit-averaged quantities or just to visualize orbits.\n",
    "In simulations with large number of markers $(\\gtrsim 10^4)$ the orbit data is rarely collected because it may use up a lot of memory and disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The orbit data collection is enabled in options by setting ``ENABLE_ORBITWRITE = 1``.\n",
    "The next option, ``ORBITWRITE_MODE``, selects whether the marker trajectory is recorded when **i)** a given amount of time has passed or **ii)** marker crosses a predetermined surface.\n",
    "The latter is used for Poincaré plots, so choose ``ORBITWRITE_MODE=1`` to collect the data in time intervals.\n",
    "The time interval is set by ``ORBITWRITE_INTERVAL`` which, if set to zero, collects the data at each integration time-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE:_** The data is not collected exactly at ``ORBITWRITE_INTERVAL`` intervals, but on the first time step when at least the set amount of time has passed from the last time orbit data was recorded.\n",
    "If desired, the only way to collect the data at fixed intervals is to use a fixed time-step and choose ``ORBITWRITE_INTERVAL`` so that it is a multiple of the time-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have ``ORBITWRITE_NPOINT`` which sets a **maximum** number of points kept in record for each marker.\n",
    "Roughly speaking, there is a fixed-size array in simulation for each marker that has length equal to this value, which is then filled one slot at a time every time the marker position is recorded.\n",
    "If this array becomes full, then the earliest record is overwritten, i.e, the array contains last ``ORBITWRITE_NPOINT`` records.\n",
    "If the array is not full at the end of the marker's simulation, the unused slots are pruned before the data is written to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferably ``ORBITWRITE_NPOINT`` is equal to the simulation time divided by ``ORBITWRITE_INTERVAL`` as then all the recorded points are kept.\n",
    "One can of course choose to keep only the last $N$ values, which could be useful for debugging simulations or seeing how exactly markers ended up on the wall.\n",
    "Just keep in mind to not use a large value for ``ORBITWRITE_NPOINT`` in simulations with a large number of markers as that will easily eat all available RAM.\n",
    "It is a good practice to check how much data was allocated for the diagnostics when using the orbit collection.\n",
    "This value is printed at the beginning of the simulation after all inputs have been initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running a simulation where orbit data is being collected\n",
    "\n",
    "First, initialize a test case where markers can be traced:"
