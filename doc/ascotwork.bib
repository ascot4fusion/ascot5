journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Neutron production rates in fusion devices are determined not only by the kinetic profiles but also the fast ion slowing-down distributions. In this work, we investigate the effect of magnetic configuration on neutron production rates in future deuterium plasmas in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator. The neutral beam injection, beam and triton slowing-down distributions, and the fusion reactivity are simulated with the ASCOT suite of codes. The results indicate that the magnetic configuration has only a small effect on the production of 2.45 MeV neutrons from thermonuclear and beam-target fusion. The 14.1 MeV neutron production rates were found to be between 1.49e12 and 1.67e12 s-1, which is estimated to be sufficient for a time-resolved detection using a scintillating fiber detector, although only in high-performance discharges.}

title = {Optimization-oriented modelling of neutral beam injection for EU pulsed DEMO},
journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Neutral beam injection (NBI) is one of the auxiliary power systems considered for the EU DEMO pulsed plasma (‘DEMO1’). In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of optimized NBI in terms of the DEMO1 requirements, relating physics and engineering contexts in a novel parameter range compared to current NBI systems and in a larger plasma volume than ITER. Different injection options are investigated to account for various concepts discussed in the literature. The investigation is carried out using a wide range of sensitivity studies by means of the METIS 0.5D transport code and ASCOT Monte Carlo simulations of injected neutral-beam particles. This investigation has generated a series of recommendations for the NBI design, contributing to the system optimization process. We show how tangential injection aimed at the plasma core, with an energy 800 keV, is recommended to maintain high fusion power performance and fulfill the requirements for bulk heating. Compliance with engineering constraints on the NBI design, e.g., the least interference with breeding blanket modules or compatibility with solutions for the beamline components, imposes some restrictions when discussing the beam geometry. The minimum density at which an NBI can be safely operated without harmful shine-through losses is investigated for different injection energies and compared to the ITER case. The NBI operational window for DEMO is shown to be significantly extended to transient, low-density phases, also highlighting the importance of NBI systems designed for modular energy and power output. NBI can therefore sustain the plasma during a considerable portion of the transient phases, i.e., the current ramp-up and ramp-down phases. The final decision on the DEMO heating mix will be made on the basis of system operability and performance: the optimized NBI is shown to be a suitable and effective option for the EU DEMO inductive scenario.}

title = {A comparative study of internal kink stability in EU DEMO designs with negative and positive triangularity},
journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Internal kink (IK) instability is investigated for European demonstration fusion reactor (EU DEMO) plasmas in both negative triangularity (NT) and positive triangularity (PT) configurations. For NT plasmas, the IK becomes more unstable as an ideal conformal wall moves away from the plasma boundary, with the mode growth rate saturating at the wall radial location of about , where a is the plasma minor radius and b the wall radial location. The plasma resistivity destabilizes the IK mode. The effect of sub-sonic toroidal plasma flow is sufficiently weak and can thus be ignored for these EU DEMO equilibria. These results are consistent with those for PT plasmas, albeit with larger mode growth rate in the NT configuration. Both perturbative and self-consistent magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)-kinetic hybrid calculations predict (partial) stabilization of the IK modes in both NT and PT configurations, with inclusion of various kinetic contributions. Precessional drift motion of trapped fusion-born alphas in EU DEMO produces weak stabilization to the IK mode. Stronger stabilization occurs with the toroidal precession of trapped thermal particles (ions and electrons) and the bounce-transit motion of thermal ions. The stabilization is similar between the NT and PT configurations, due to the similarity of the mode eigenfunction (occupying a nearly circular region in the plasma core) despite the sign difference in the triangularity. The non-perturbative MHD-kinetic hybrid model predicts much less stabilization of the mode than the perturbative model, primarily due to the self-consistent determination of the mode eigenvalue in the former. Generally, no significant difference in the IK mode stability is found between the NT and PT plasmas in EU DEMO.}

title = {Validating the ASCOT modelling of NBI fast ions in Wendelstein 7-X stellarator},
journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {The first fast ion experiments in Wendelstein 7-X were performed in 2018. They are one of the first steps in demonstrating the optimised fast ion confinement of the stellarator. The fast ions were produced with a neutral beam injection (NBI) system and detected with infrared cameras (IR), a fast ion loss detector (FILD), fast ion charge exchange spectroscopy (FIDA), and post-mortem analysis of plasma facing components.  The fast ion distribution function in the plasma and at the wall is being modelled with the ASCOT suite of codes. They calculate the ionisation of the injected neutrals and the consecutive slowing down process of the fast ions. The primary output of the code is the multidimensional fast ion distribution function within the plasma and the distribution of particle hit locations and velocities on the wall. Synthetic measurements based on ASCOT output are compared to experimental results to assess the validity of the modelling.  This contribution presents an overview of the various fast ion measurements in 2018 and the current modelling status. The validation and data-analysis is on-going, but the wall load IR modelling already yield results that match with the experiments.}

Fast particles in the form of NBI ions can escape the confinement due to magnetic perturbations and produce a significant power load on the first wall. In this contribution, we use the fast ion orbit-following code ASCOT to study NBI losses under the effects of 3D magnetic perturbations, including toroidal field ripple and ferritic inserts. The losses were found to not endanger the integrity of the wall, with loads remaining below 40 kW/m2 even with unmitigated ripple, and losses did not increase above 2.5 % even with 16 toroidal field coils. Ionization in the scrape-off layer was not found to increase the losses significantly for realistic density profiles, and the design of the wall allows for some flexibility in the distance between the plasma and the first wall tiles.}

abstract = {Heating and current drive systems such as high energy Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) are being considered for pulsed EU DEMO (“DEMO1”) pre-conceptual design. Their aim is to provide auxiliary power, not only during flat-top, but also during transient phases (i.e. plasma current ramp-up and ramp-down). In this work, NBI fast particle power loads on DEMO1 first wall, due to shine-through and orbit losses, are calculated for the diverted plasma ramp-up phase. Numerical simulations are performed using BBNBI and ASCOT Monte Carlo codes. The simulations have been done using a complete 3D wall geometry, and implementing the latest DEMO NBI design, which foresees NBI at 800 keV particle energy. Location and power density of NBI-related power loads at different ramp-up time steps are evaluated and compared with the maximum tolerable heat flux taken from ITER case. Since NBI shine-through losses (dominant during low density phases) depend mainly on the beam energy, plasma density and volume, DEMO has a more favourable situation than ITER, enlarging NBI operational window. Using ITER criteria, DEMO NBI at full energy and power could be switched on during ramp-up at <ne> ~ 1.3 × 1019 m-3. This increases the appeal of neutral beam injectors as auxiliary power systems for DEMO.}

A qualitative benchmark is attempted in this article with the ASCOT code. We set up a full 3D model of the TEXTOR tokamak and studied the influence of different physical mechanisms and their strengths on molybdenum deposition patterns on the simulated plasma-facing components: atomic processes, Coulomb collisions, scrape-off layer (SOL) profiles, source distribution, marker starting energy, radial electric field strength, SOL flow and toroidal plasma rotation. The outcome comprises 13 simulations, each with 100,000 markers. The findings are:•Toroidal plasma movement, either within the LCFS or as SOL flow, is negligible.•SOL profile and marker starting energy have modest impact on deposition.•Source distribution has a large impact in combination with radial electric field profiles.•The E⇀×B⇀ drift has the highest impact on the deposition profiles.}

abstract = {Using the orbit-following code ASCOT, we have modelled fast ion transport in ITER under the influence of ELM control coils (ECCs), toroidal field ripple, and test blanket modules, with emphasis on how the plasma response (PR) modifies the transport mechanisms and fast ion loads on the divertor. We found that while PR shields the plasma by healing broken flux surfaces at the plasma periphery, it also opens a new loss channel for marginally trapped particles: PR causes strong toroidal variation of the poloidal field near the X-point which leads to de-localisation of banana tips and collisionless transport. The reduction in passing particle losses and the increase in marginally trapped particle losses shift divertor loads from targets to the dome and under-the-dome structures. The plasma response was calculated by both MARS-F and JOREK codes. The new transport mechanism was stronger for PR calculated by JOREK which, unlike MARS-F, explicitly includes the X-point.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {We discuss α-particle velocity-space diagnostic in ITER based on the planned collective Thomson scattering (CTS) and γ-ray spectrometry (GRS) systems as well as ASCOT simulations of the α-particle distribution function. GRS is sensitive to α-particles with energies  MeV at all pitches p, and CTS for  MeV and . The remaining velocity space is not observed. GRS and CTS view the plasma (almost) perpendicularly to the magnetic field. Hence we cannot determine the sign of the pitch of the α-particles and cannot distinguish co- and counter-going α-particles with the currently planned α-particle diagnostics. Therefore we can only infer the sign-insensitive 2D distribution function  by velocity-space tomography for  MeV. This is a serious limitation, since co- and counter-going α-particle populations are expected to have different birth rates and neoclassical transport as well as different anomalous transport due to interaction with modes such as Alfvén eigenmodes. We propose the installation of an oblique GRS system on ITER to allow us to diagnostically track such anisotropy effects and to infer the full, sign-sensitive  for  MeV. α-particles with  MeV are diagnosed by CTS only, which does not allow velocity-space tomography on its own. Nevertheless, we show that measurements of the α-particle energy spectrum, which is an ITER measurement requirement, are now feasible for  MeV using a velocity-space tomography formalism assuming isotropy in velocity space.}

abstract = {We demonstrate the measurement of a 2D MeV-range ion velocity distribution function by velocity-space tomography at JET. Deuterium ions were accelerated into the MeV-range by third harmonic ion cyclotron resonance heating. We made measurements with three neutron emission spectrometers and a high-resolution γ-ray spectrometer detecting the γ-rays released in two reactions. The tomographic inversion based on these five spectra is in excellent agreement with numerical simulations with the ASCOT–RFOF and the SPOT–RFOF codes. The length of the measured fast-ion tail corroborates the prediction that very few particles are accelerated above 2 MeV due to the weak wave-particle interaction at higher energies.}

For this purpose, high-fidelity magnetic backgrounds were reconstructed, taking into account even the internal structure of the ferritic inserts and tritium breeding modules (TBM). The beam ions were found to be almost perfectly confined in all scenarios, and only the so-called hybrid scenario featured alpha loads reaching 0.5 MW due to its more triangular plasma. The TBMs were not found to jeopardize the alpha confinement, nor cause any hot spots. Including plasma response did not bring dramatic changes to the load. The ELM control coils (ECC) were simulated in the baseline scenario and found to seriously deteriorate even the beam confinement. However, the edge perturbation in this case is so large that the sources have to be re-evaluated with plasma profiles that take into account the ECC perturbation.}

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Disruption-generated runaway electrons (RE) present an outstanding issue for ITER. The predictive computational studies of RE generation rely on orbit-averaged computations and, as such, they lack the effects from the magnetic field stochasticity. Since stochasticity is naturally present in post-disruption plasma, and externally induced stochastization offers a prominent mechanism to mitigate RE avalanche, we present an advection–diffusion model that can be used to couple an orbit-following code to an orbit-averaged tool in order to capture the cross-field transport and to overcome the latter’s limitation. The transport coefficients are evaluated via a Monte Carlo method. We show that the diffusion coefficient differs significantly from the well-known Rechester–Rosenbluth result. We also demonstrate the importance of including the advection: it has a two-fold role both in modelling transport barriers created by magnetic islands and in amplifying losses in regions where the islands are not present.}

abstract = {We assess the effect of the European design of the pebble-bed helium-cooled test blanket modules (TBM) on fast ion power loads on ITER material surfaces. For this purpose, the effect of not only the TBMs but also the ferritic inserts (FI), used for mitigating the toroidal field ripple, were included in unprecedented detail in the reconstruction of the 3-dimensional magnetic field. This is important because, due to their low collisionality, fast ions follow the magnetic geometry much more faithfully than the thermal plasma. The Monte Carlo orbit-following code ASCOT was used to simulate all the foreseen operating scenarios of ITER: the baseline 15 MA standard H-mode operation, the 12.5 MA hybrid scenario, the 9 MA advanced scenario, and the half-field scenario with helium plasma that will be ITER’s initial operating scenario. The effect of TBMs was assessed by carrying out the simulations in pairs: one including only the effect of ferritic inserts, and the other including also the perturbation due to TBMs. Both thermonuclear fusion alphas and NBI ions from ITER heating beams were addressed. The TBMs are found to increase the power loads, but the absolute values remain small. Neither do they produce any additional hot spots.}

A carefully chosen solid sample is exposed to the flux, and the impinging ions transmute the material making it radioactive. Ultra-low level gamma-ray spectroscopy is used post mortem to measure the activity and, thus, the number of fusion products.

This contribution presents the numerical analysis of the first measurement in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, which was also the first experiment to measure a single discharge. The ASCOT suite of codes was used to perform adjoint/reverse Monte Carlo calculations of the fusion products. The analysis facilitates, for the first time, a comparison of numerical and experimental values for absolutely calibrated flux. The results agree to within a factor of about two, which can be considered a quite good result considering the fact that all features of the plasma cannot be accounted in the simulations.Also an alternative to the present probe orientation was studied. The results suggest that a better optimized orientation could measure the flux from a significantly larger part of the plasma.

A shorter version of this contribution is due to be published in PoS at:  1st EPS conference on Plasma Diagnostics}

abstract = {Neutral beam injection (NBI) will be one of the main sources of heating and non-inductive current drive in ITER. Due to high level of injected power the beam induced heat loads present a potential threat to the integrity of the first wall of the device, particularly in the presence of non-axisymmetric perturbations of the magnetic field. Neutral beam injection can also destabilize Alfvén eigenmodes and energetic particle modes, and act as a source of plasma rotation. Therefore, reliable and accurate simulation of NBI is important for making predictions for ITER, as well as for any other current or future fusion device. This paper introduces a new beamlet-based neutral beam ionization model called BBNBI. It takes into account the fine structure of the injector, follows the injected neutrals until ionization, and generates a source ensemble of ionized NBI test particles for slowing down calculations. BBNBI can be used as a stand-alone model but together with the particle following code ASCOT it forms a complete and sophisticated tool for simulating neutral beam injection. The test particle ensembles from BBNBI are found to agree well with those produced by PENCIL for JET, and those produced by NUBEAM both for JET and ASDEX Upgrade plasmas. The first comprehensive comparisons of beam slowing down profiles of interest from BBNBI + ASCOT with results from PENCIL and NUBEAM/TRANSP, for both JET and AUG, are presented. It is shown that, for an axisymmetric plasma, BBNBI + ASCOT and NUBEAM agree remarkably well. Together with earlier 3D studies, these results further validate using BBNBI + ASCOT also for studying phenomena that require particle following in a truly three-dimensional geometry.}

Unavoidable geometry simplifications changed the mass of the TBMs and ferritic inserts (FIs) up to 26%. This has been compensated for by modifying the nonlinear ferromagnetic material properties accordingly. Despite the simplifications, the computation geometry and the calculated fields are highly detailed. The combination of careful FEM mesh design and using BSLIM enables the use of the fields unsmoothed for particle orbit-following simulations. The magnetic field was found to agree with earlier calculations and revealed finer details. The vector potential is intended to serve as input for plasma shielding calculations.}

abstract = {In this paper three-dimensional (3D) kinetic Monte Carlo orbit-following simulations are carried out with the ASCOT code to estimate the alpha particle driven current and torque profiles in ITER baseline scenarios. Several different 3D magnetic field configurations, including TF ripple, ferritic inserts, test blanket modules and edge localized mode coil perturbations, are used in these simulations. The alpha particle current is found to be less than one percent for all configurations and scenarios. In axisymmetric magnetic field configurations, the collisional and j × B torque components cancel each other, whilst in non-axisymmetric cases, the total torque is nonzero. The total alpha driven torque is found to oppose that generated by the neutral beam injection particles and to be an order of magnitude smaller. Consequently, alpha particles will not significantly contribute to the plasma current nor act as a source of plasma rotation in the ITER baseline scenarios considered.}

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Evidence for low field side accumulation of tungsten is often observed in bolometry and soft x-ray emissivities of highly rotating JET ITER-like wall (ILW) plasmas. Poloidal variation of the density of high-Z impurities, such as tungsten, in the core of NBI heated plasmas is expected from neoclassical theory due to charge displacement and parallel electric field generated by the centrifugal force. We calculate the poloidally asymmetric distribution of tungsten using fluid equations and a 1D transport simulation with the JETTO/SANCO code. Peaking of tungsten on the outboard side of the plasma is found and verified with soft x-ray and bolometry measurements. We then study the effect of a poloidally asymmetric tungsten distribution on the distribution of the NBI heat source by simulations with the Monte Carlo code ASCOT. The simulations show that the poloidally asymmetric tungsten profile redistributes the fast NBI ions radially through shifting their ionization profile and poloidally through enhanced pitch-angle scattering at high energy. The amplitude of the redistribution is in the order of 10% for the highest nW/ne ratios of ∼10−4 measured in recent JET H-mode plasmas. As a result of the scattering of the beam particles, the core heat deposition is changed less than 10%, which does not have a significant impact to the performance of JET plasmas. The modelling is in qualitative agreement with measurements by the vertical neutron camera that sees a broadening in the 2.5 MeV neutron profile when tungsten peaks on the outboard side of the plasma.}

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {The migration of impurities in tokamaks has been studied with the help of tracer-injection (13C and 15N) experiments in JET and ASDEX Upgrade since 2001. We have identified a common pattern for the migrating particles: scrape-off layer flows drive impurities from the low-field side towards the high-field side of the vessel. Migration is also sensitive to the density and magnetic configuration of the plasma, and strong local variations in the resulting deposition patterns require 3D treatment of the migration process. Moreover, re-erosion of the deposited particles has to be taken into account to properly describe the migration process during steady-state operation of the tokamak.}

The localization of the hot spots on the protective tiles is in fair agreement with fast-ion loss simulations using a range of codes: ASCOT, SPIRAL and OFMCs while the codes predicted peak heat loads that are within 30% of the measured ones. The orbit calculations take into account the birth profile of the beam ions as well as the scattering and slowing down of the ions as they interact with the localized TBM field. The close agreement between orbit calculations and measurements validate the analysis of beam-ion loss calculations for ITER where ferritic material inside the tritium breeding TBMs is expected to produce localized hot spots on the first wall.}

In addition to an magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-quiescent plasma we now also address the power loads in the presence of relevant MHD events: both neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) and toroidal Alfvén eigenmodes (TAEs) are included in the simulation model. In the case of NTMs, the total power load to the wall is found to depend on the perturbation amplitude. Even with the strongest perturbation, however, the power load density stays within the design limit of the ITER wall materials. In the case of TAEs, while the wall power load density stays at the MHD-quiescent level, significant redistribution of alphas inside the plasma was observed. This was also found to affect the alpha heating profile.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {The effect of ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) edge localized mode (ELM)-mitigation coils on fast ion wall loads was studied with the fast particle following Monte Carlo code ASCOT. Neutral beam injected particles were simulated in two AUG discharges both in the presence and in the absence of the magnetic field perturbation induced by the eight newly installed in-vessel coils. In one of the discharges (#26476) beams were applied individually, making it a useful basis for investigating the effect of the coils on different beams. However, no ELM mitigation was observed in #26476, probably due to the low plasma density. Therefore, another discharge (#26895) demonstrating clear ELM mitigation was also studied. The magnetic perturbation due to the in-vessel coils has a significant effect on the fast particle confinement, but only when total magnetic field, Btot, is low. When Btot was high, the perturbation did not increase the losses, but merely resulted in redistribution of the wall power loads. Hence, it seems to be possible to achieve ELM mitigation using in-vessel coils, while still avoiding increased fast ion losses, by simply using a strong Btot. Preliminary comparisons between simulated and experimental fast ion lost detector signals show a reasonable correspondence.}

We simulate the losses of fusion alpha particles and neutral beam injection-generated fast ions in ITER under the influence of the 3D perturbations caused by toroidal field coils, ferritic inserts, test blanket modules and ELM control coils (ECCs) with the ASCOT code. The ECCs are found to stochastize the magnetic field deep inside the pedestal in the 15 MA inductive reference operating scenario. Such a field is found insufficient to confine not only the fast but also the thermal ion population, leading to a strongly reduced fast ion source in the edge. Therefore, even with a stochastic edge, no high fast ion power loads are expected. However, the plasma response has not yet been included in the calculation of ITER magnetic background data, and it is probable that the perturbation is currently overestimated.}

In addition to the well-known TF ripple, the 3D effect due to ferromagnetic materials (in ferritic inserts and test blanket modules) and ELM mitigation coils are included in these mechanisms. ITER scenario 4 was chosen since, due to its lower plasma current, it is more vulnerable for various off-normal features. First, the validity of using a 2D equilibrium was investigated: a 3D equilibrium was reconstructed using the VMEC code, and it was verified that no 3D equilibrium reconstruction is needed but it is sufficient to add the vacuum field perturbations onto an axisymmetric equilibrium. Then the alpha particle confinement was studied using three independent codes, ASCOT, DELTA5D and F3D OFMC, all of which assume MHD quiescent background plasma and no anomalous diffusion. All the codes gave a loss power fraction of about 0.2%. The distribution of the peak power load was found to depend on the first wall shape. We also made the first attempt to accommodate the effect of fast-ion-related MHD on the wall loads in ITER using the HMGC and ASCOT codes. The power flux to the wall was found to increase due to the redistribution of fast ions by the MHD activity. Furthermore, the effect of the ELM mitigation field on the fast-ion confinement was addressed by simulating NBI ions with the F3D OFMC code. The loss power fraction of NBI ions was found to increase from 0.3% without the ELM mitigation field to 4–5% with the ELM mitigation field.}

abstract = {The level and distribution of the wall power flux of energetic ions in ITER have to be known accurately in order to ensure the integrity of the first wall. Until now, most quantitative estimates have been based on the assumption that fast ion transport is dictated by neoclassical effects only. However, in ITER, the fast ion distribution is likely to be affected by various MHD effects and probably also by microturbulence. We have now upgraded our orbit-following Monte Carlo code ASCOT so that it has simple, theory-based models for neoclassical tearing mode (NTM)-type islands as well as for turbulent diffusion. ASCOT also allows for full-orbit following, which is important close to the material surfaces and, possibly, also when strong toroidal inhomogeneities are present in the magnetic field. Here we introduce the new models, preliminary results obtained with them, and how these models could be made more realistic in the future. The simulations are carried out for thermonuclear alpha particles in ITER scenario 2 plasma, because we consider this combination to be most critical for the successful operation of ITER. Neither the turbulent transport nor NTM-type islands are found to introduce alarming changes in the wall loads. However, at this stage it was not possible to combine the island structures with the non-axisymmetric magnetic field of ITER, and it remains to be seen what the combined effect of drift islands together with the toroidal ripple and local field aberrations, such as those due to test blanket modules and resonant magnetic perturbations will be.}

Heating of the protective tiles on the front of the TBM surface was found when neutral beams were injected and the TBM fields were engaged. The fast-ion core confinement was not significantly affected. Different orbit-following codes predict the formation of a hot spot on the TBM surface arising from beam ions deposited near the edge of the plasma. The codes are in good agreement with each other on the total power deposited at the hot spot, predicting an increase in power with decreasing separation between the plasma edge and the TBM surface. A thermal analysis of the heat flow through the tiles shows that the simulated power can account for the measured tile temperature rise. The thermal analysis, however, is very sensitive to the details of the localization of the hot spot, which is predicted to be different among the various codes.}

The measured CTS spectra as well as the inferred one-dimensional fast ion velocity distribution functions are clearly asymmetric as a consequence of the anisotropy of the beam ion populations and the selected geometry of the experiment. As expected, the one-beam configuration can clearly be distinguished from the two-beam configuration. The fast ion population is smaller and the asymmetry is less pronounced for the one-beam configuration. Salient features of the numerical simulation results agree with the CTS measurements while quantitative discrepancies in absolute values and gradients are found.}

The simulations were carried out using the Monte Carlo guiding-centre orbit-following code ASCOT. The FIs were found very effective in ameliorating the detrimental effects of the toroidal ripple: the fast ion wall loads are reduced practically to their negligible axisymmetric level. The thermonuclear alpha particles overwhelmingly dominate the wall power flux. In scenario-4 practically all the power goes to the limiters, while in scenario-2 the load is fairly evenly divided between the divertor and the limiter, with hardly any power flux to other components in the first wall. This is opposite to earlier results, where hot spots were observed with 2D wall (Tobita et al 2003 Fusion Eng. Des. 65 561–8). In contrast, uncompensated ripple leads to unacceptable peak power fluxes of 0.5 MW m−2 in scenario-2 and 1 MW m−2 in scenario-4, with practically all power hitting the limiters and substantial flux arriving even at the unprotected first wall components. The local TBM structures were found to perturb the magnetic field structure globally and lead to increased wall loads. However, the TBM simulation results overestimate the TBM contribution due to an over-simplification in the vacuum field. Therefore the TBM results should be considered as an upper limit.}

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Auxiliary heating such as neutral beam injection (NBI) and ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) will accelerate ions in ITER up to energies in the MeV range, i.e. energies which are also typical for alpha particles. Fast ions of any of these populations will elevate the collective Thomson scattering (CTS) signal for the proposed CTS diagnostic in ITER. It is of interest to determine the contributions of these fast ion populations to the CTS signal for large Doppler shifts of the scattered radiation since conclusions can mostly be drawn for the dominant contributor. In this study, distribution functions of fast ions generated by NBI and ICRH are calculated for a steady-state ITER burning plasma equilibrium with the ASCOT and PION codes, respectively. The parameters for the auxiliary heating systems correspond to the design currently foreseen for ITER. The geometry of the CTS system for ITER is chosen such that near perpendicular and near parallel velocity components are resolved. In the investigated ICRH scenario, waves at 50 MHz resonate with tritium at the second harmonic off-axis on the low field side. Effects of a minority heating scheme with 3He are also considered. CTS scattering functions for fast deuterons, fast tritons, fast 3He and the fusion born alphas are presented, revealing that fusion alphas dominate the measurable signal by an order of magnitude or more in the Doppler shift frequency ranges typical for fast ions. Hence the observable CTS signal can mostly be attributed to the alpha population in these frequency ranges. The exceptions are limited regions in space with some non-negligible signal due to beam ions or fast 3He which give rise to about 30% and 10–20% of the CTS signal, respectively. In turn, the dominance of the alpha contribution implies that the effects of other fast ion contributions will be difficult to observe by CTS.}

abstract = "Currently, plasmas with internal transport barriers (ITBs) appear the most likely candidates for steady-state scenarios for future fusion reactors. In such plasmas, the broad hot and dense region in the plasma core leads to high fusion gain, while the cool edge protects the integrity of the first wall. Economically desirable large bootstrap current fraction and low inductive current drive may, however, lead to degraded fast ion confinement. In this work the confinement and heating profile of fusion alphas were compared between H-mode and ITB plasmas in realistic JET geometry. The work was carried out using the Monte Carlo-based guiding-center-following code ASCOT.For the same plasma current, the ITB discharges were found to produce four to eight times more fusion power than a comparable ELMy H-mode discharge. Unfortunately, also the alpha particle losses were larger (~16%) compared with the H-mode discharge (7%). In the H-mode discharges, alpha power was deposited to the plasma symmetrically around the magnetic axis, whereas in the current-hole discharge, the power was spread out to a larger volume in the plasma center. This was due to wider particle orbits, and the magnetic structure allowing for a broader hot region in the centre.",

abstract = {The neutral beam injected fast ion distribution at the ASDEX Upgrade edge region is studied focusing on the difference between co- and counter-injected neutral beams. The slowing-down distribution of beam ions is simulated using the orbit-following Monte Carlo code ASCOT. The edge fast ion density and its gradient are higher for counter-injection than for co-injection. Also the distribution in the velocity space is different: for co-injection, there exists a population of untrapped particles which for counter-injection is found only when the effect of a non-constant, experimentally obtained quiescent H-mode radial electric field is included in the simulation. Toroidal ripple removes ions having small particle pitch, thereby reducing the density and density gradient, whereas the radial electric field has the opposite effect. Including simultaneously the effects of both ripple and the radial electric field restores the distribution close to the ideal case where both of them are neglected. The radial electric field is found to squeeze the orbit of a counter-injected neutral beam ion but to widen the orbit of a co-injected ion, and to cause transitions in the orbit topologies which are reflected in the fast ion distribution.}

abstract = {The fast particle flux onto the material surfaces and the fast ion edge distribution are compared between ASDEX Upgrade H-mode and quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) in the presence of toroidal ripple and radial electric field Er by using the orbit-following Monte Carlo code ASCOT. So far, the QH-mode has been obtained only with counter-injection of the neutral beams. The wall load caused by co-injected beams in H-mode is small and without ripple it is negligible. With counter-injection (QH-mode case), the wall load is substantial even without the ripple. The ripple always increases the wall load, but the divertor load is either decreased or is unchanged. The effect of Er alone is small, but it boosts the ripple-trapping of beam particles near the location of its maximum absolute value on the horizontal midplane. The fast ion density and its gradient in the pedestal region are higher for counter-injected than for co-injected particles. The ripple decreases the density gradient in both the cases. To make a connection with the experiment, the flux of high-energy tritons from beam–plasma interactions onto the surfaces is evaluated. The simulated flux of tritons impinging on the material surfaces is in qualitative agreement with the measured tritium distribution on the wall and divertor.}

journal = {Europhysics Letters},
abstract = {We would like to discuss the role that 1 MeV tritons produced in deuterium–deuterium fusion reactions might play in a long-pulse or steady-state fusion reactor. Albeit a small minority in quantity compared to the fuel tritium, the fusion tritons have significantly longer penetration length in materials and can have detrimental consequences for the integrity of the components. Because deeply deposited atoms are not easily removed from the plasma-facing components, the fusion tritium inventory in a steady-state device is expected to be limited only by decay. Furthermore, unlike fuel tritium, it is not evenly distributed on the plasma-facing components. We conclude that, of the materials considered here, tungsten appears better than carbon or beryllium in this respect. Nonetheless, 1 MeV tritons from deuterium fusion should not be neglected when making material choices for ITER and, especially, for future fusion reactors. In particular, studies on the bulk effects of deeply penetrated tritium in tungsten are urgently needed if metal-wall reactors are considered for the future. This is an interdisciplinary problem needing the attention of material scientists and plasma physicists.}

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {In this paper we provide evidence that, for fusion energy production, advanced scenarios based on the presence of an internal transport barrier (ITB) have some advantages compared with the standard H-mode operation. This is due to their magnetic properties that affect alpha particle heating and helium exhaust. With identical density and temperature profiles, a qs-profile with reversed central shear, typical of an ITB plasma, is found to provide the same amount of total heating as a monotonous qs-profile, but with a broader heating profile. The overall confinement of alphas is almost the same for both profiles, but the neoclassical, energy-dependent alpha transport barrier due to stagnation orbits is closer to the magnetic axis for the monotonous profile. Therefore, the reversed profile helps to confine 3.5 MeV alphas born over a wider region while letting through the cooled-down He-ash.}

abstract = {The stationary edge localized mode (ELM)-free ‘Quiescent H-mode’ (QH-mode) regime, obtained with counter neutral beam injection, is studied in ASDEX Upgrade and Joint European Torus. QH-mode plasmas have high pedestal and core ion temperatures together with good High-confinement mode (H-mode). ELMs are replaced by continuous MHD oscillations, the ‘edge harmonic oscillation’ (EHO) and the ‘high frequency oscillation’. Stationarity of particle and impurity densities is linked to the occurrence of these MHD modes. The EHO location in the steep-gradient region and its appearance with increasing edge pressure points towards the edge pressure or pressure gradient as possible drivers for the EHO. Injection of small cryogenic pellets can raise the plasma density to about 40% of the Greenwald density limit without triggering ELMs. Orbit following calculations of the slowing-down distribution show the presence of an enhanced fast particle density in the H-mode barrier region despite the large loss currents with counter-injection. The radial electrical field in the edge barrier region, about twice as large in QH-mode as in ELMy H-mode, is large enough to reverse the precession drift direction of injected beam ions, leading to a resonance of the EHO with the drift precession frequency.}

The QH-mode regime is obtained with all accessible NBI angles, with and without additional ion cyclotron heating, at various values of edge safety factor q95 and at values of Zeff down to 2.5 after fresh boronization. In contrast to the ELMy H-mode, the pedestal pressure depends significantly on radial heat flux in the QH-mode, giving rise to a reduced heating power degradation of H-mode confinement. The ‘edge harmonic oscillation’, a characteristic MHD feature of the QH-mode that replaces ELMs, occurs at rational surfaces in the H-mode barrier region, and has so far been found only with a toroidal mode number n = 1. These conditions seem to define windows in q95 for favourable QH-mode access.}

The simulated and measured profiles agree quite well in all discharges, suggesting that IOL is indeed the mechanism responsible for the narrow profiles. The interaction between energetic ions and scrape-off layer (SOL) ions/atoms was also investigated, resulting in SOL power stopping factors of 60–80%. The momentum transfer via IOL to background ions was found to be in the same direction as the observed SOL flows (towards the inner target) but too small to be their primary cause. Preliminary simulation of IOL on ITER indicate peak heat loads <2 MW/m2 at the outer target.}

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {In low-current tokamaks, in the absence of radial electric fields (Er), the widths of the drift orbits are large and the direct orbit losses can extend deep into the plasma. Furthermore, in such a plasma even a modest Er can produce rotation with a poloidal Mach number (Mp) that exceeds unity. Using the Monte Carlo code ASCOT, which follows charged particle orbits in the five-dimensional phase space, the formation of an internal transport barrier (ITB) in such a tokamak is investigated. Carrying out the simulations for the geometry corresponding to the FT-2 tokamak, it is shown that if, under these conditions, a steep density gradient is created in the plasma, the plasma responds by generating a strong (much stronger than needed to compensate the diamagnetic drift) Er in the region of the strong gradient. The generation appears to be a pure neoclassical effect, but a global solution over the entire plasma cross section is required to fully identify it. As a result, an ITB-like situation with a strongly sheared E×B flow is obtained inside the plasma. In these circumstances Mp&gt;1, and thus the orbits of the majority of ions become strongly squeezed. The neutral fluxes observed by neutral particle analysers are also simulated to find out if the neutral spectra can be utilized to estimate the Er values across the plasma cross section in the FT-2 tokamak.}

abstract = {A detailed Monte Carlo-based numerical analysis of  ASDEX Upgrade discharges is presented, examining the  applicability of neutral particle analysers (NPAs) for measuring the  central ion temperature from the neutral particle spectra above  the  neutral beam injection energy. The analysis is motivated by  an earlier work carried out for TFTR (Fiore C L et al  1988 Nucl. Fusion  28 1315), where the beams were quite tangential. This work is now extended  to investigate the applicability of the method when the beams are perpendicular. The Monte  Carlo simulations take fully into account the effects due to finite orbits and realistic  magnetic geometry, and reveal that the fast ion distribution  above the beam energy, generated by collisions, reflects the  background temperature with good accuracy. However, it is found that the use of NPA  tends to give temperature values that are up to 30% lower  than the on-axis temperature Ti(0) assumed for the  background. This is because the neutral fluxes measured by  NPA originate from a wide radial region, and thus the measured  spectrum is a chord-averaged one. A fairly tangential viewing is  found to be  optimal because in that case the signal  originating from the centre of the plasma is enhanced relative  to the signal from outer radii. It is concluded that, in  discharges where the slowing down from electrons does not  dominate the beam ion dynamics, NPA can give a reliable estimate of an average central  temperature, Ti(ρ = 0,...,0.3).}

In H-mode plasmas, a narrow feature was observed in the power profile, which scaled inversely with power entering the scrape-off-layer, λq,nw∝PSOL-0.4±0.1, while the base profile showed virtually no power dependence. At constant input power, the peak heat flux was strongly reduced by D2 puffing (from ~20 to 4 MW m-2), with the narrow feature in the power profile effectively suppressed. Based on numerical analysis using a guiding-centre Monte-Carlo code ASCOT, coupled to a fluid-like plasma-neutral code package OSM2/EIRENE, the above results are interpreted as a consequence of inter-ELM ion orbit loss from the pedestal region.}

abstract = "With a careful choice of the viewing parameters, neutral-particle analysers could be used to detect small changes in the radial electric field Er immediately next to the separatrix with a submillisecond (50-100 µs) resolution. In particular, the poloidal viewing angle has to be optimized according to the ripple- and plasma geometry. In addition, the use of a small diagnostic beam is proposed to improve the signal level and quality.",

The neoclassical radial electric field Er shows no bifurcation in contrast with earlier orbit loss models, but the shear in Er reaches values at which a transition to enhanced confinement has been observed. Also, MHD turbulence analysis shows that a smooth transition can occur through the neoclassical E~ × B~ flow shear suppression. The parameter scaling of threshold temperature for suppression of turbulence agrees with the H-mode threshold scaling in ASDEX Upgrade.",

abstract = "The density of ripple-trapped ions is strongly influenced by negative radial electric fields that can compensate the grad B drift. This density can be monitored with a time resolution of about by the measurement of charge-exchange neutral particle fluxes. According to Monte Carlo and Fokker-Planck calculations these fluxes should respond with a time delay of less than , if the halfwidth of the electric field is reasonably large (a few centimetres). In the experiment, rise times of the fluxes after the L-H transition are longer or about 1 ms; jumps of the electric field in much shorter times can be excluded under such circumstances. The same is found for the H-L transition, where the flux measurement does not show any indication for a fast drop of the fields.",

title = "Analysis of the Tokamak ripple-blocked ion distribution with abrupt changes of a radial electric field",
abstract = "Convective transport of non-thermal, ripple-blocked ions in the presence of a rapidly varying radial electric field (Er) is investigated by numerically solving a relevant kinetic equation in tokamak geometry. Near the plasma periphery, at small poloidal angles, a strong suppression in the deeply ripple-blocked ion distribution is observed in the absence of a radial electric field for particle energies exceeding a collisional threshold. The deficit of the ripple-blocked ions is found to be rapidly filled by the onset of an inward radial electric field of a sufficient magnitude. The time scale for this filling can be explained by the different blocked-ion drift orbit topologies generated by the radial electric field, and it is determined by the convective drift time of ripple-blocked ions from the inner, well-filled ripple region to the depleted region along these orbits. Consequently, the time scale can be much faster than the collisional time scale, and the blocked ion distribution function should faithfully follow the changes in the radial electric field. Thus the present mechanism gives a physical basis for the earlier interpretation of experimental results [W. Herrmann and ASDEX Upgrade Team, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4401 (1995)] that the measured changes in the neutral fluxes from charge exchange processes with ripple-blocked ions are caused by changes in the radial electric field. The dependence of the neutral flux changes on collisionality as well as on the width and magnitude of a radial electric field with a Gaussian potential profile are studied.",

It is shown numerically that the deficit is rapidly filled (in <100 μs) by the onset of an inward Er and that the filling results from modifications in the ion drift orbits, connecting the inner undepleted regions to the nearly empty ripple loss region. The increase in the neutral particle flux from the ripple blocked ions, observed at an L-H transition, is reproduced using two independent numerical methods by turning on a large Er.",
